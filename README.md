# Reforged
A successor (not port) of Balkon's Weapon Mod, will add primitive, medieval and some gunpowder weapons. <br>
This successor has been created by Silvercatcher and ThexXTURBOXx. <br>
We have taken some textures of BalkondeurAlpha to test WIP-Things. <br>
Other textures are by Snow_Yoshi98 and baddaspig. <br>
<br>
Reforged - Balkon's Weapon Mod for 1.8? <br>
Yes, it is! But it is in early development. Much things won't work properly.
