# Reforged
A successor (not port) of Balkon's Weapon Mod, will add primitive, medieval and some gunpowder weapons.
This successor has been created by Silvercatcher and ThexXTURBOXx.
We have taken some textures of BalkondeurAlpha to test WIP-Things.
Other textures are by Snow_Yoshi98 and baddaspig.

Reforged - Balkon's Weapon Mod for 1.8?
Yes, it is! But it is in early development. Much things won't work properly.
