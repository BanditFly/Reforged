Before you ask: You MAY use this mod in your modpack, but keep that in mind:
This mod is still ALPHA, so there will be bugs! You have the responsibility.
We won't be to blame, when anything in your client doesn't work properly after installing our mod.
AND: Give credit to us please. Don't say it's your mod, it is Silvercatcher's, ThexXTURBOXx's and the texturer's!
AND: You may NOT mirror a link to our mod or earn money with it. This mod is FREE!
